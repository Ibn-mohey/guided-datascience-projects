# [Statistical Data Visualization in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-visualization/home/welcome)

## Course Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on two learning objectives:

1. Learn Data Visualization Techniques in Python.
2. Create useful and powerful plots and graphics.

By the end of this course, you will be able to **create and visualize scatter plots, line plots, bar charts, subplots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, and animations**.

## What We will accomplish this by completing each task in the project:

- Understand the importance of Statistical Data Visualization.
- Apply Basic Statistics
- Create Statistical Plots and Charts with Seaborn
- Create Statistical Plots and Charts with Plotly
- Create Statistical Plots and Charts with Matplotlib

## Course Structure
This course is divided into 3 parts:
1. Course Overview: This introductory reading material.
2. Plots (Graphics) for Data Science: This is the hands-on project that we will work on in Rhyme.
3. Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.
